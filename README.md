## How to Use (GUI)

1. **Launch the application** as Administrator/Root
   - Windows: Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
   - Linux/macOS: Use `sudo`

2. **Select your network interface** from the dropdown menu
   - Click "Refresh" if your adapter doesn't appear

3. **Choose a spoofing method:**

   **Method A - Quick Random MAC:**
   - Click **"‚ö´ SPOOF ON"** to instantly spoof with a random MAC
   - Button changes to **"üü¢ RESTORE ORIGINAL"** when actively spoofing
   - Click **"üü¢ RESTORE ORIGINAL"** to restore your original MAC

   **Method B - Vendor MAC (Two Steps):**
   - **Step 1:** Click **"Use Random Vendor"** to select a random vendor (e.g., Apple, Samsung)
     - OR manually select a vendor from the dropdown
     - This only *selects* the vendor, doesn't activate spoofing yet
   - **Step 2:** Click **"‚ö´ SPOOF ON"** to apply the selected vendor's MAC
   - Each click of "Use Random Vendor" cycles through different vendors

   **Method C - Custom MAC (Two Steps):**
   - **Step 1:** Enter your desired MAC in the format `00:11:22:33:44:55`
   - **Step 2:** Click **"Use Custom MAC"** to apply it immediately

4. **Restore original MAC:**
   - Click **"üü¢ RESTORE ORIGINAL"** to restore your original MAC address

5. **Monitor System Stats (Live Updates):**
   - **System Stats panel** on the right side shows real-time information:
     - **Original MAC**: Your adapter's original MAC address (stored when first selected)
     - **Current MAC**: Live MAC address (updates every second - shows spoofed MAC when active)
     - **IP Address**: Live IP address (updates every second - perfect for VPN monitoring)
   - Use this to verify MAC spoofing is working
   - Monitor IP changes when connecting/disconnecting VPNs
   - All stats update automatically every second

6. **Change Themes:**
   - Press **'T'** key anytime to cycle through 11 different color themes
   - Press **'S'** key to randomize Skittles theme (generates new random colors instantly!)
   - Available themes:
     - **Dark Mode** - Classic dark theme (default)
     - **Flash Bang** - Blinding light theme (‚ö†Ô∏è eye protection recommended)
     - **Cyberpunk** - Neon cyberpunk aesthetic
     - **Matrix** - Green on black hacker style
     - **Ocean** - Cool ocean blues
     - **Sunset** - Warm sunset purples
     - **Hacker Green** - Terminal-style green

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows
- Some network adapters may require manual MAC change via Device Manager
- The application provides instructions in the log window
- You may need to disable/enable the adapter after changing MAC
- Some WiFi adapters don't support MAC spoofing
- Registry method is used to set MAC addresses

### Linux
- Requires `root` privileges (use `sudo`)
- Uses `ip link` commands to change MAC addresses
- Works with most network adapters

### macOS
- Requires `root` privileges (use `sudo`)
- Uses same commands as Linux
- May require disabling System Integrity Protection for some adapters

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed: `python --version`
- Run as administrator/root
- Check if tkinter is installed: `python -m tkinter`

### MAC address won't change
- **Windows:** Some adapters require manual change via Device Manager (see log for instructions)
- Verify your adapter supports MAC address changes
- Try a different network adapter
- Check administrator/root privileges

### Interface not showing
- Click the **"Refresh"** button
- Restart the application
- Verify the adapter is enabled in your system settings

### How to verify MAC changed
- **Windows:** Run `ipconfig /all` in Command Prompt and check "Physical Address"
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `ip link show` or `ifconfig` and look for the interface

### Spoofing doesn't persist after reboot
- This is expected behavior
- MAC spoofing is temporary and resets when the adapter or system restarts
- Re-run the spoofer after each reboot if needed

## Technical Details

### How It Works

**Windows:**
- Modifies the `NetworkAddress` registry key for the network adapter
- Registry path: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}`
- Disables and re-enables the adapter to apply changes

**Linux/macOS:**
- Uses `ip link` or `ifconfig` commands
- Brings interface down, changes MAC, brings it back up

### MAC Address Format

- Standard format: `00:11:22:33:44:55`
- First 3 bytes (octets): Manufacturer OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
- Last 3 bytes: Device-specific identifier
- Locally administered MACs have bit 1 of first octet set to 1
